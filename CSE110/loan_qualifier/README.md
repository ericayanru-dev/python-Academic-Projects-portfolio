##  Description

This project helps simulate a **loan decision-making process** based on:
- Loan size
- Credit history
- Income level
- Down payment

Users enter values from **1 to 10** for each factor. The program uses **nested conditionals and Boolean logic** to determine whether the loan should be approved.

##  How to Run

```bash
python loan_qualifier.pySample Output
Loan size rating (1–10): 6
Credit history rating (1–10): 8
Income level rating (1–10): 6
Down payment rating (1–10): 5

The decision is YES — This is a good loan.
